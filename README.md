# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Hamdan Khan, a third-year Software Engineering student at Ontario Tech University, passionate about problem-solving and creative software solutions. My technical skills span across languages like Java, JavaScript, Python, and C++, with experience in frameworks and tools such as Flask, React, MySQL, and GitHub.

üîç I have developed several independent projects, including a Hospital Laboratory System, a 2D Tower Defense Game, and a Pok√©mon-Themed Todo List, where I applied my knowledge in object-oriented programming, REST APIs, agile development, and user-centered design. My hands-on approach has consistently improved engagement and efficiency in these projects.

üíº In addition to my studies, I have professional experience as a Lead Sales Associate, where I honed my collaborative and analytical skills in a high-energy team environment.

üí° I'm currently expanding my knowledge in SDLC, machine learning, and web development, with a keen interest in CI/CD and software testing. I enjoy exploring innovative technologies and applying them to real-world problems.

üåü Feel free to connect with me or check out my projects on GitHub!
